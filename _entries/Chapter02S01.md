You've taken the first step on your adventure, but you are still a 0th level human. Don't despair, because you become 1st level when you create your first character, and progress from there! To create a character, follow the nine steps below:

1. Start with a fresh character sheet. You can copy the one provided in this book, download and print one, or reproduce it by hand on a piece of paper. If all else fails, just scribble down notes on scratch paper!

2. Roll 3d6 in order for your character's ability scores, as described below under Character Abilities, and write the results after the names of the abilities. Write down the ability score bonus or penalty for each score, as shown on the [Ability Score](Chapter02.md#ability-score) table.

3. Choose a class which suits your character's abilities from the [Character Classes](Chapter02.md#character-classes) section. All classes have prime requisites, and some classes require minimum scores for some abilities. If abilities are not quite high enough for the class you would like to play, see [Classes and Ability Scores](Chapter02.md#classes-and-ability-scores) for some options to adjust your scores. Write down the special abilities of your class, as described for each class.

4. Note on your character sheet that your character has zero (0) experience points (or XP); you may also want to note the number needed to advance to second level, as shown in the table for your class. Gaining experience points is explained in the [Adventures](Chapter06.md#chapter-6-adventures) and [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapters.

5. Roll hit points (hp) using the appropriate die for your class, adding your Constitution bonus or penalty, and note the result as your hit points on your character sheet. If your character has a Constitution penalty, the penalty will not lower any Hit Die roll below 1. (At your Judge's discretion, you may begin with the maximum hit points for 1st level.)

6. Record your character's attack throws and saving throws on your character sheet. Attack throws and saving throws are listed with each class, and described fully in the [Adventures](Chapter06.md#chapter-6-adventures) chapter. Note that attacks with melee weapons are modified by your Strength, while missile weapons such as bows or thrown daggers are modified by Dexterity. Don't forget to adjust your attack throws to reflect these modifiers.

7. Choose your character's starting proficiencies from the [Proficiencies](Chapter04.md#chapter-4-proficiencies) chapter. Apply any modifiers to your ability scores, hit points, attack throws, or saving throws from proficiencies. If you have chosen to play a mage or elven spellsword, roll for your starting spells, as described in the [Spells](Chapter05.md#chapter-5-spells) chapter.

8. Generate your character's starting wealth by rolling 3d6x10 gold pieces (gp) and purchase equipment for your character from the lists in the [Equipment](Chapter03.md#chapter-3-equipment) chapter. Write your purchases on your character sheet, and note how much money remains afterward. Make sure you understand the weapon and armor restrictions for your class before making your purchases. Since you now know what armor your character is wearing, note your Armor Class (AC) on the character sheet based on the type of armor you choose. Don't forget to add your Dexterity bonus or penalty to AC. Likewise, record your weapon damages based on the type of weapons you choose, modified by your Strength bonus or penalty. Calculate your character's encumbrance based on how much weight he is carrying.

9. Give your character a name, and create a description of what your character looks like, his personality, and maybe even a brief note about the character's background. Then choose an appropriate Alignment for your character. Your Judge will have information on the setting of your character's world that can be helpful in naming your new character and developing his background.


### Generating Multiple Characters (Optional)

As an optional rule, at the start of play, each player generates five characters and select one primary and two back-up characters. The remaining two characters are given to the Judge to use as NPCs to populate the campaign setting. If the primary and back-ups are all killed, the player generates five additional characters, again picking three and giving the Judge two. This ensures that the player always has a variety of characters to choose from to find one he likes, and gives the Judge some additional NPCs to populate the world.
